              Hello! My name is Annukul and I enjoy creating things that create
              an impact on life of people. My interest in programming started
              back in initial days of my college when I decided to start my own
              blog on wordpress. And later I got to know about web development
              and how you can develop your own website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I started my web development learning journey on FreeCodeCamp. And
              gradually I started loving what I was doing and then created
              several projects on my own.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Fast-forwarding to today, I have worked with multiple clients in
              building their wep app from scratch and also re-writing old web
              apps. I have also worked on several native consumer facing mobile
              applications using React Native.
